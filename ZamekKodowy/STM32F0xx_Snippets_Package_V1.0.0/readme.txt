@par Snippet Description 

The snippets are code examples. 
Their main purpose is to show how to use the STM32F0xx peripherals.
They have been designed to run on the STM32F072B Discovery board (MB1076).
The target is :
    - to illustrate the Reference Manual with code,
    - to help the customer developping its own directory or writing direct register
      access code.
These examples assume the clock has been yet configured at 48MHz and the registers are in 
their reset states.
Some parts are given as example, typically the error management and must be configured 
following customer application needs.
The error management of the polling loops are kept empty and must be filled according to
customer robustness policy.
Some functions, such as sinewave generation in DAC examples, are not optimized and have been 
written only to visualize the product feature.

@note The "system_stm32f0xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to meet user application requirements. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F0xx_Clock_Configuration_VX.Y.Z.xls" 
      provided with the AN4055 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/class/1734.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
